# Horizontal Scaling (scale out/in)

*Horizontal scaling* means **adding more nodes** to (or removing nodes from) a system, such as adding a new computer to a dstributed software application.

High-performance computing applications, such as seismic analysis and biotechnology, scale workloads horizontally to **support tasks that once would have required expensive supercomputers**.

Other workloads, such as large social networks, exceed the capacity of the largest supercomputer and can only be handled by horizontally scalable systems.

> Exploiting this scalability requires software for efficient resource management and maintenance.
